## 📋 **Project Overview**

### 🎯 **Research Problem**
Sri Lankan paddy farmers face multiple challenges that threaten productivity and sustainability:
- **Inefficient & Reactive Farming:** Reliance on outdated methods and intuition
- **Critical Knowledge Gaps:** Lack of real-time, hyper-local advisory services
- **High Post-Harvest Losses:** 15% losses due to improper storage and timing
- **Barriers to Technology Adoption:** Complex and expensive solutions inaccessible to smallholders

### 🎯 **Main Research Objective**
To design and develop an integrated, AI-driven web platform that provides Sri Lankan paddy farmers with data-guided decision-making support across the entire cultivation lifecycle, aiming to increase productivity, profitability, and resilience against climate and pest risks.
